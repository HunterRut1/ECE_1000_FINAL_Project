1. Connecting the Relay:
      -VCC of Relay to 3.3V on Pico
      -GND of Relay to GND on Pico
      -IN of relay to GPIO pin on Pico (GP15)
2. Connecting the Soil Moisture Sensor:
      -VCC of the sensor to 3.3V on Pico
      -GND of the sensor to GND on the Pico
      -Signal pin to an ADC pin (GP26)
3. Connecting the Water Pump:
      -Positive terminal of the pump to the NO terminal of the relay
      -Negative terminal of the pump to the negative terminal of the 9V battery
      -COM of the relay to the positve terminal of the 9V battery

How it works:
The system works by first testing the moisture level (capacitance) of the soil. If it is below a certain level the pico sends a signal to the relay to turn on the pump. If it is above a certain level nothing happens. After this the system sleeps for 5
seconds before running the code again.
