1. Connecting the Relay:
      -VCC of Relay to 3.3V on Pico
      -GND of Relay to GND on Pico
      -IN of relay to GPIO pin on Pico (GP15)
2. Connecting the Soil Moisture Sensor:
      -VCC of the sensor to 3.3V on Pico
      -GND of the sensor to GND on the Pico
      -Signal pin to an ADC pin (GP26)
3. Connecting the Water Pump:
      -Positive terminal of the pump to the NO terminal of the relay
      -Negative terminal of the pump to the negative terminal of the 9V battery
      -COM of the relay to the positve terminal of the 9V battery
